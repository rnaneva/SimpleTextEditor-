# SimpleTextEditor-
Implement 4 types of commands related to manipulating the text:     • "1 {string}" - appends [string] to the end of the text.     • "2 {count}" - erases the last [count] elements from the text.     • "3 {index}" - returns the element at position [index] from the text.     • "4" - undoes the last not-undone command of type 1 or 2 and returns the text to the state before that operation.
